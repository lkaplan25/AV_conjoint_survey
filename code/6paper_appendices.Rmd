# Appendix A: Full Survey


## Transportation Research Study

Welcome! 

You are invited to take part in a research study being conducted by John Helveston, Ph.D., Assistant Professor in Engineering Management and Systems Engineering at the George Washington University.

Please read this form and ask us any questions that will help you decide if you want to be in the study. Taking part is completely voluntary and even if you decide you want to, you can quit at any time.

You must be at least 18 years old to take part in this study. You are 1 of up to 5,000 people taking part in this study by GWU. <br><br>

#### Procedures

The total expected amount of time you will spend on this study is 10 minutes. <br><br>

#### Risks & Confidentiality

The study has no expected risks.

You are free to skip any questions or stop taking the survey at any point. We are not collecting your name or other identifiable information about you, and all data will be encrypted. The records of this study will be kept private. In any published articles or presentations, we will not include any information that will make it possible to identify you as a subject. Your records for the study may be reviewed by departments of the University responsible for overseeing research safety and compliance. Once all data are collected, anonymized versions of the data will be made publicly available on a repository on GitHub.

You need not respond to the demographic questions at the end, including questions about age, gender identity, ethnicity, and formal education. We collect this information strictly for the purposes of performing demographic comparisons of the data with that of the general public. Survey responses without answers to demographic question may exclude your response from being included in some of these comparisons. Data without demographics may still be presented in some summary totals. <br><br>


#### Benefits

Taking part in this research will not help you directly, however the benefit to society will be a better understanding of people's preferences for automated transportation modes in the United States. <br><br>
        
#### Compensation

This survey is made available to respondents via Dynata, which offers great diversity in incentives as some people are motivated by cash, points, or by being able to donate to charity. A cash reward is simply a monetary value in $USD. Points are values that can be traded in for different, non-monetary rewards on the research platform. Finally, donations to a charity of your choice can also be selected as a reward. Dynata aims to respond to all of these individual motivations in order to provide a sample which is diverse and as representative as possible of the target population. Dynata uses a reasonable level of reward based on the amount of effort required, the population, and appropriate regional customs. Regardless of the type of incentive, the value is the same for every respondent in a given study. <br><br>

#### Questions 

Talk to the research team if you have questions, concerns, complaints, or think you have been harmed. You can contact the Principal Investigator listed above at 202-994-7173.

## What are automated vehicles? 

This survey will ask about your preferences for different automated and non-automated transportation modes. To start, let's learn a little bit more about what automated vehicles are.

Automated vehicles or “driverless cars” are vehicles that are operated by computer systems instead of human drivers. Many cars today include automated features like automatic braking and lane-keeping assistance. In a fully automated vehicle, a computer system would perform all driving tasks with no assistance from a human driver.<br>
The following short video will explain a little more about different levels of vehicle automation and how automated vehicles work.

This survey will ask you to compare nonautomated and automated transportation modes. When the survey describes a mode as **automated**, it is referring to a **level 5 fully-automated** vehicle, meaning that the vehicle would drive itself at all times and in all situations without any human assistance.  
 
To start, we’d like to learn a little bit about your current transportation routine and your general thoughts about automated vehicles.

-----------------------------------

## Your current transportation routines 

This section includes questions related to your transportation routines and attitudes towards automated vehicles. Given that your transportation routines may have changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, please consider your transportation routines **prior to the pandemic**.


1.	Which of the following modes of transportation do you use **regularly (at least a few times per week)**?
*	Personal vehicle
*	Bus
*	Rail 
*	Ride-hailing service
*	Shared ride-hailing service
*	MetroAccess
*	Other:

2. Which of the following modes of transportation do you use **occasionally (a few times per month)**?
*	Personal vehicle
*	Bus
*	Rail 
*	Ride-hailing service
*	Shared ride-hailing service
*	MetroAccess
*	Other:

3. 	Which of the following modes of transportation have you **never** used?
*	Personal vehicle
*	Bus
*	Rail 
*	Ride-hailing service
*	Shared ride-hailing service
*	MetroAccess

-------------------



4. For each of the following transportation modes, please check how your use of the mode has changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic:

Mode  | Use more than before | Use the same as before | Use less than before
------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------
Bus (e.g., Metrobus, ART, Ride On) |            |       |
Rail (Metrorail or DC streetcar)    |           |       |
Ride-hailing service (e.g., Lyft, Uber, Via) |    |       |
Shared ride-hailing service (e.g., Lyft Shared or UberPool) |       |       |


5. To what degree do you agree with the following statements? (5-point scale from Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree)

* I am familiar with the concept of automated vehicles. 
* I would feel comfortable riding in a fully-automated vehicle. 
* Automated vehicles will increase transportation costs. 
* Automated vehicles will be safer than human-driven vehicles 
* Automated vehicles will cause more problems than they will solve. 
* Automated vehicles will improve the availability of transportation options. 
* I am willing to share an automated vehicle with people I don’t know. 
* I have easy access to public transportation where I live. 
* I have easy access to a personal vehicle 

-------------------------

## Transportation Mode Options 
<br>
Now that you’ve shared about your current transportation routine, we’d like you to consider a future in which you can choose from various automated and non-automated transportation options. <br>

Let’s learn about these potential transportation options. 

----------------------------------

## Transportation Mode Options 

#### **Bus** (e.g., Metrobus, ART, Ride On) <br>

</center>
<blockquote>
Please imagine that in the future, buses could be automated or non-automated. <br>
Automated buses would follow the same pre-determined routes as non-automated buses but would not have a bus driver.
</blockquote>


#### **Rail** (Metrorail, DC Streetcar) <br>

</center>

<blockquote>
Please imagine that in the future, rail systems (Metrorail, DC Streetcar) would remain non-automated. <br>
They would function the same as they do now and would follow the same routes.
</blockquote>

#### **Ride-hailing Service** (e.g., Lyft, Uber, Via) <br>
<center>
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/3890/14220914237_858b13ac8e.jpg" width="500" height="304" alt="Screenshots of Lyft and Uber apps showing vehicle locations on a map">
</center>

<blockquote>
Please imagine that in the future, ride-hailing services could be automated or non-automated <br>
The ride-hailing service would be similar to Uber, Lyft or Via. <br> 
 You would order a vehicle using a smartphone and could select both your pickup and dropoff locations.
 </blockquote>
 
 
#### **Shared Ride-hailing Service** (e.g., Lyft Shared, UberPool)

<center>

</center>

<blockquote>
 Please imagine that in the future shared ride-hailing services could be automated or non-automated. <br>
The services would be similar to UberPool or Lyft Shared. You would order a vehicle using a smartphone and could select both the pickup and drop-off locations. <br>
Rides would be shared with other passengers who are not a part of your group but are traveling along a similar route.
 </blockquote>

-----------------------------------

## Mode Features

<br> Some of the transportation modes (bus, ride-hailing, shared ride-hailing) could have special features. These features include being automated or having an attendant on board.

<h3> Automated </h3>
  <center>
 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lkaplan25/AV_conjoint_survey/main/driverless.png" alt="Icon of car emitting light rays from a sensor on its roof." style="height:200px">
</center> 
<blockquote>
 Vehicles that are automated would be operated by computer systems with no assistance from a human driver. No option to take control of the vehicle would be available.<br>
</blockquote>

<h3> Attendant </h3>
  <center>
 <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lkaplan25/AV_conjoint_survey/main/attendant.png" alt="Icon of driver attendant." style="height:200px">
</center> 
<blockquote>
 Vehicles with an attendant would have a company official on board to help passengers. This attendant would not be responsible for operating the vehicle.<br>
</blockquote>

<br>


Only automated modes would have the potential to have an attendant on board, as shown in the diagram below. <br><br>
